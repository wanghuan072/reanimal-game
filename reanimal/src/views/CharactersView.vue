            <p>
              The monsters in Reanimal are designed to create tension and fear while encouraging strategic thinking. Rather than relying solely on combat, players must use stealth, puzzle-solving, and cooperation to overcome threats. The twisted animals serve as obstacles that test players' understanding of the game's mechanics and their ability to work together.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each enemy type teaches players different skills: some emphasize stealth, others require timing and coordination, and some test players' ability to use the environment creatively. This variety keeps the gameplay engaging and ensures that players must adapt their strategies throughout the game.
