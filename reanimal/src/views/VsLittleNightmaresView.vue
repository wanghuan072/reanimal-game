              After being acquired by <strong>Embracer Group</strong> in 2019, Tarsier Studios gained more creative freedom and resources to develop Reanimal as a new IP. This allowed the studio to push the boundaries of what they achieved with Little Nightmares, creating a more ambitious and polished horror experience.
